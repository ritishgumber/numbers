In this problem, you have to find the last three digits before the decimal point for the number (3 + √5)n.

For example, when n = 5, (3 + √5)5 = 3935.73982... The answer is 935.

For n = 2, (3 + √5)2 = 27.4164079... The answer is 027.

Input

The first line of input gives the number of cases, T. T test cases follow, each on a separate line. Each test case contains one positive integer n.

Output

For each input case, you should output:

Case #X: Y
where X is the number of the test case and Y is the last three integer digits of the number (3 + √5)n. In case that number has fewer than three integer digits, add leading zeros so that your output contains exactly three digits.
